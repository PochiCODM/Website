      <h1> IM LIAM <span> PITCHAN </span> </h1>
      <p>&nbsp&nbsp Hello My name is Sebastien Liam L. Pitchan, Im 16 years old and currently studying in OLOPSC(OUR LADY OF <br/>PERPETUAL SUCCOR COLLEGE).
         As a Senior Highschool Student in OLOPSC primarily Grade 11, I realized that <br/> I must become more matured especially since Im almost in college, And I also realized that Senior Highschool 
         <br/>is more stressful than Junior Highschool, There are alot more activities and outputs that are required in SHS <br/>that made me realized that I need to start being a responsible student although Im not a bad student in my <br/>JHS years, I obtained honors 
         from time to time, yet I mostly play at home though right now I just want to <br/> learn new things, Do my best in school, because I realized that if I put a lot of effort into something I can <br/>achieve it , and right now I have a goal of achieving
         honors this semester.</br>
