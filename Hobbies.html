	  <p> &nbsp&nbspOne of my favorite my favorite hobbies are biking, I just love to bike and travel. It is also good for me <br/> since its cardio and an overall leg day whenever I bike. I just also love going to places with a bike the air that <br/>hits your face just makes me feel relax all of a sudden. I also like it when I overtake cars using a bike it makes <br/> me feel that my legs are stronger than they look and also since my friends love to bike I enjoy biking with them.</p>
        <img src="guitar.jpg" class="guitar" width="400" height="350">
		<p2> &nbsp&nbspGuitar is probably my favorite hobby it was actually passed down by my father. He used to play in a band so I <br/> learned to play guitar because of him. 
		I loved playing guitar since It was fun being able to play your favorite songs. Even I stopped playing guitar from time to time because I don't have time it's still my favorite hobby.</p2>

		primarily  <br/> the naruto series it just made me happy whever I watch anime. anime is somewhat my comfort thing  <br/> whever Im stressed. But I also like animes like AOT, Dragonball, one piece, fairy tail and alot more.</p3>
		<img src="music.jpg" class="music" width="400" height="350">
		<p4> &nbsp&nbspIm also a music lover I guess it's pretty obvious I mean almost all guitarist love listening to music. My favorite music right now is probably kundiman by Silent Sanctuary. I just love it's intro it just sounds so good.</br> But I also listen to old songs like hotel california, bohemian rhapsody, and many more.
